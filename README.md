# 🧱 OOP Assignment – Custom Class & Polymorphism Challenge

This project is a hands-on exercise in Object-Oriented Programming with Python. It contains two key parts:

## 1️⃣ Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class

We create a `Book` class with attributes like title, author, year, and genre. Then we extend it with a `ComicBook` subclass to demonstrate **inheritance** and **method overriding**.

### Key Concepts:
- Constructors (`__init__`)
- Instance Methods
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation
- Method Overriding

## 2️⃣ Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge

We create a base class `Vehicle` and define subclasses: `Car`, `Plane`, and `Boat`. Each subclass overrides the `move()` method in its own way.

### Output Example:
```bash
Driving 🚗
Flying ✈️
Sailing ⛵
